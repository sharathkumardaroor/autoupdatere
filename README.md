# AutoUpdateRE

**AutoUpdateRE** is a Python-powered tool that simplifies your Git workflow by automating commit and push operations for multiple local repositories. With a sleek, user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter, you can effortlessly manage your repositories, set custom commit messages, and schedule automated updates every 30 minutes.

## Features

- **Intuitive GUI:**  
  Manage your repositories with a fully integrated graphical interface.
  
- **Automated Git Operations:**  
  Automatically commit and push changes across all registered repositories at a set interval (default is every 30 minutes).

- **Dynamic Repository Management:**  
  Easily add or remove repository paths through the GUI. All settings are stored in a JSON file that is automatically created if it doesn't exist.

- **Customizable Commit Messages:**  
  Specify a custom commit message that is used for both manual and scheduled operations.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Provides console feedback for successful operations and errors to help with troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Git:** Ensure Git is installed and available in your system's PATH.
- **Tkinter:** Usually included with Python (if not, install the appropriate package for your OS).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharathkumardaroor/autoupdatere.git
   cd autoupdatere
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   If your project uses additional dependencies, install them via pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: This project primarily relies on Python's standard libraries.)*

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python autoupdatere.py
   ```

2. **Using the GUI:**

   - **Add Repository:**  
     Click the **"Add Repository"** button to select a local repository. The selected path will be saved in `repos.json`.

   - **Remove Repository:**  
     Select a repository from the list and click **"Remove Selected"** to delete it from your configuration.

   - **Set Commit Message:**  
     Enter your desired commit message in the text field and click **"Save Settings"**.

   - **Manual Git Operations:**  
     Click **"Commit and Push Now"** to immediately commit and push changes for all registered repositories.

   - **Automated Updates:**  
     Click **"Start Auto Update"** to begin automatic Git operations at 30-minute intervals. Use **"Stop Auto Update"** to halt the process.

## How It Works

- **GUI Interface:**  
  The application utilizes Tkinter to provide a simple yet effective interface, making repository management and Git operations accessible even to those with minimal command-line experience.

- **JSON Configuration:**  
  Repository paths and commit settings are stored in a JSON file (`repos.json`). This file is created automatically if it doesn't exist, ensuring a seamless first-time setup.

- **Background Processing:**  
  A dedicated background thread handles automated Git operations, allowing you to continue using the GUI without interruption.
